# Powerbox

The Powerbox is a physical device similar to a Powerstrip. It contains a Raspberry Pi.

This repository represents a service which runs on the device. This service can be accessed on the local network to configure the device. Configuration consists of setting a timezone, as well as scheduling the power outlets.

The software will enable and disable GPIO ports which will in turn enable and disable relays controlling separate power banks.

This hardware and software was designed by me though it has been independently created by hundreds of other people.
